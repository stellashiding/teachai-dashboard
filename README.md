# 🧠 TEACH-AI Dashboard (Prototype)

The **TEACH-AI Dashboard** is an open-source prototype to evaluate generative AI tutors using the **TEACH-AI Benchmark Framework**.  
It helps researchers and educators assess models across **10 educational dimensions** — from Explainability and Helpfulness to Accessibility and Ethics — using an **LLM-as-Judge** approach.

## 🚀 Features
- Evaluate AI tutor responses using standardized scoring (1–5)  
- Includes 10 TEACH-AI components with prompt-based questions  
- Built in **Python + Flask** with a simple evaluation UI  
- Designed for future dashboard visualization and open collaboration

## 📊 Example Use
Example evaluation task (EarSketch / Deeproject context):

> **Prompt:** “How can you make your music composition in EarSketch more expressive using code?”
>
> **Model Responses:**  
> GPT-4: “Use automation to gradually increase volume and add echo for emotional effect.”  
> Claude-3: “Try combining rhythm variation and panning to make transitions feel more human.”  
> Gemini-1.5: “Layer multiple instrument tracks and change effects dynamically with loops.”

Each response is scored automatically across the TEACH-AI dimensions.
